Hello, my name is Kira Stevenson and I am a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Economics. This page is to showcase the projects I create in a class called Data Storytelling. I am excited to learn about the different ways to utilize Github. I grew up in Pasadena, CA but am currently in Bethlehem. Throughout the past few years at Lehigh, I have had to present and submit many research papers that involved some sort of data interpretation. Because of this, I have always looked for the best ways to present my final results. However, I often have found myself using the same typical data table, which is not entirely visually appealing. I am taking this class to learn how to best portray my results to readers. (Additionally – this is a class I wish I had the opportunity to take in the beginning of my college career, as I feel learning how to tell a story through data is important throughout not only a professional career but also academic). In my free time I enjoy hiking, cooking and other outdoor activities.
